Problem: I really like goodreads for tracking books I've read/want to read, but it's missing a lot of features that I want, such as being able annotate or review the books prively.

Solution: To create an application that connected to a user's Goodreads, and provided a private note taking place for each book.

Technical Difficulties

Goodreads API Docs are not very good
-They're limited in details
-There are not many forums with helpful responses
-Request return XML, rather than JSON
-Testing the Oauth is made more difficult that I don't have control over revoking those oauths and removing my app from the user's is also not doable, currently. I ended up making a few bogus goodreads accounts to test my oauth.
